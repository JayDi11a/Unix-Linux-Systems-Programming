Project: sttyl

Purpose: sttyl is a program that is designed to display and optionally edit terminal settings.

Outline:
        The program reads the terminal settings from stdin. If no arguments are given
        it prints a human readable version of the settings.
        If setting arguments are supplied, they are used to update the terminal settings
        before printing a human readable version of the changes to the settings.

Output:
        The form of output is intended to resemble that of stty from what was specified in the
	assigment specs.
Arguments:
        The program accepts no arguments or a series of them that correspond with
        the terminal settings as listed in termios.h file.

Input:
        The program actual doesn't accept any user input. The terminal settings get read
        in and its the arguments themselves that are the only data that get acted upon.

Data Structures:
        The program uses an array of structs as a table lookup to identify the
        appropriate locations to read and/or update. The tables are of two
        different types: bitField updates and control character updates. The bitfields 
        also list offsets to the register containg the bit field. Otherwise, both tables
        contain a string representing the update location, and the integer that corresponds to
        its bitmask or array location.

Files:
        The program was intended to work on terminal devices.
