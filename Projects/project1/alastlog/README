Project 1: alastlog
geraldtrotman@fas.harvard.edu

I created two versions of alastlog. The first one I worked on last year which was a combination of Whodate and Lastlogin that I managed to break. Now it produces segmentation faults and I am not sure why. I then reproached it using the who3 example and beyond some structural output, didn't really have much more time to work on it.

In this submission is my alastlog1.c, alastlogin.c, README, plan, typescript, another typescript called original,and the files that were included in the assignment initially.
