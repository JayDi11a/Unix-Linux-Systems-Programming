Project: alastlog 

Purpose: A program to display the contents of a utmp file in human-readable form displaying the last login	   of either a specified user or all the contents from the lastlog binary file.

Outline:
	alastlog reads the utmp file record by record and 
        presents the contents in human-readable form.  The
        form of output is one line per record with fixed-width fields,
        all in text.
        dumputmp uses read to get data from the file, and uses
        printf to format and output results.

Output:
	The output looks like:
        logname, tty, pid, type, text version of type, time, host

Arguments:
	alastlog accepts up to 4 command line argument, which are a sequnce of -u flag followed by the
	specific user name or -t flag follwed by the days a user may have been on last, or the -f flag
	followed by the binary file and any combination of the other flag options.

Input:
        alastlog does not accept any user input; the datafile is the
        only source of input

Data Structures:
        alastlog reads and writes one record at a time.  It only needs
        to store a single record, so one variable of type struct utmp
        is used.

Files:
       	alastlog reads a file of utmp records.  See Arguments and Input
