Project: whodate and lastlogin 

Purpose: Programs to display the contents of a utmp file in human-readable form

Outline:
	whodate and lastlogin reads the utmp file record by record and 
        presents the contents in human-readable form.  The
        form of output is one line per record with fixed-width fields,
        all in text.
        
	lastlogin and whodate uses read to get data from the file, and uses
        printf to format and output results.

Output:
	The output looks like:
           logname, tty, pid, type, text version of type, time, host

Arguments:
	whodate and lastlogin  accept one command line argument, a file to dump.
        If no filename is given, dumputmp processes UTMP_FILE as defined
        in utmp.h

Input:
        lastlogin and whodate take an -f flag and wtmp file, a user name or a date in (yyyy mm dd) format

Data Structures:
        lastlogin and whodate reads and writes one record at a time.  It only needs
        to store a single record, so one variable of type struct utmp
        is used.

Files:
        lastlogin and whodate reads a file of utmp records.  See Arguments and Input
        sections above.
