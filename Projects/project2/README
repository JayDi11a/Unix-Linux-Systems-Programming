           Assignment 2: pfind

1. My submission includes pfind, a makefile, typescript, and an outline of my
plan for the assignment.

2. The 3 examples of tools I chose that process directories are: dir, grep, and zip.

Using "dir -R dir_name" will recursively list the contents of a directory and its
sub-directories.

Using "grep -r pattern dir_name" will recursively searcch the files in
dir_name and its sub-directories for lines containing a match for pattern.

Using "zip -r foo dir_name" will recursively save all the files and sub-directories in
dir_name into a zip archive called foo.zip.

3. One possible way to circumvent the file limit would be to maintain a linked list of
structs. These structs would consist of a pointer to a struct dirent and a
pointer to the struct for the next sub-directory. That way, if the resource
limit is reached, the linked list would have the information necessary to
continue the operation.
