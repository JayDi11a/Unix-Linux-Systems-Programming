Project: pfind


Purpose: 
	The program, pfind, finds and displays the names and paths of files 
	that match a given name pattern or file type.

Outline:
        pfind opens a directory, reads it and checks each entry and
        subdirectory for files that may match certain criteria.
        The form of output is one line of text for each entry found.

Output:
        The output resembles that of:
           find

Arguments:
        The program accepts a directory name, with an option name search pattern
        and optional type specifier

Input:
        The program does not accept any user input; the datafile and arguments
        are the only source of input

Data Structures:
        Reads in one struct dirent at a time and acts on it. Makes recursive
        calls to itself which could cause it to store many dirent structs when
        used on a deep directory structure.


Files:
        The program works on directories
~
